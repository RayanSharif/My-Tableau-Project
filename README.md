# My-Data-Science-Practicum-Project

**Rayan T. Sharif - Regis University**

### Why My Story is Useful

As an interested student in religions, I am looking to simplify and show statistics of religions around the world for previous decades, 1950 to 2010, and show them in a visualization method to be easy for people who are interested in this topic.

### About the Data

I wanted to find a reliable data source for my practicum project in religions. As a result, I found the World Religion Project (WRP) that has regional and national datasets which are created by Zeev Maoz, University of California-Davis, and Errol A. Henderson, Pennsylvania State University.
WRP regional and national datasets contain information about the census of religions in different regions and countries. In this project, I want to benefit from the data that gives me valuable information about religions and where they exist.  

### Let Get Started Using Tableau 10.5

### Using Horizontal Bars in Tableau for All Religions

I'm going to start by showing all religions in our world in 2010 and sorting them in descending order by using horizontal bars. 

                                           -Famous Religions in the World in 2010-

### Top 5 Religions in the World, 1950-2010
After showing all religions, I will choose top 5 religions that were the top in 2010. Then, I will show their number of adherents per each decades, 1950-2010. After that, we can notice in each decade which religion has the most adherents and which one has the least. 

                                                 -Top 5 Religions-

### Differences and Changes in Top 5 Religions in the World, 1950-2010
Based on change on Christianity, Islam, Hindu, Non-Religious, and Syncretic Religions during previous decades, we need to understand changes and differences that occurred on them. So, by using Tableau, I used horizontal and side-by-side bars to show change percentage that happened in 2010 compared to 1950. Also, I analyzed data to get the average percentage for the growth of religions and the confidence interval for their growth.

### The Distribution of Religions by Countries - Using Maps

To show the geographical distribution of religions in our world, I will use world maps that color all countries based on the majority and minority of religions.

                                            -The Christianity Map World-

                                                -The Islam Map World-
![IslamMap](https://github.com/RayanSharif/My-Tableau-Project/blob/master/Islam-map.PNG)

                                                -The Hindu Map World-
![HinduMap](https://github.com/RayanSharif/My-Tableau-Project/blob/master/Hindu-map.PNG)

                                            -The Non-Religious Map World-
![Non-ReligMap](https://github.com/RayanSharif/My-Tableau-Project/blob/master/Non-religious-map.PNG)


### The Distribution of Religions by Countries - Using Tree-maps
For more clarification, I used map-trees to organize countries by sizes and colors from the most adherents to the least.

                                                    -Hindu Maptrees-
![HinduTreemaps](https://github.com/RayanSharif/My-Tableau-Project/blob/master/Hindu-treemaps.PNG)

                                                -Non-Religious Maptrees-
![Non-religTreemaps](https://github.com/RayanSharif/My-Tableau-Project/blob/master/Non-religious-treemaps.PNG)


### Top 3 Countries have Majority Adherents Christianity, Islam, and Non-Religious
According to previous Tree-maps for Christianity, Islam, and Non-Religious, I picked up top three countries to show them in side-by-side bars to figure out numbers of adherents for the previous decades from 1950 to 2010.

                                            -Top 3 Countries - Christianity-

![Top3IslamCntry](https://github.com/RayanSharif/My-Tableau-Project/blob/master/Top-3-countries-Islam.PNG)

                                            -Top 3 Countries - Non-Religious-
![Top3Non-religCntry](https://github.com/RayanSharif/My-Tableau-Project/blob/master/Top-3-countries-non-relig.PNG)


### Top 3 Countries have Majority Adherents Christianity, Islam, Hindu, and Non-Religious
To check changes and differences in Christianity, Islam, and Non-Religious in countries that they are majority, I choose the top three countries for these religions. Then, I analyzed differences by finding percentage average of growth and confidence interval for the previous decades. Also, I got a change  of percentage growth for the religions for top three countries for 2010 compared to 1950

### My Expectiations for Religions in 2020
Depend on average and %CI, I give expectations for total number of religions in 2020 and expected number of adherents in top three countries where they are majority in 2010.
