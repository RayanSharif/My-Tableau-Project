# My-Data-Science-Practicum-Project

**Rayan T. Sharif - Regis University**

### Why My Story is Useful

As an interested student in religions, we are looking to simplify and show statistics of religions around the world for previous decades, 1950 to 2010 and show them in visualization methods to be easy for people who are interested in this topic,

### About the Data

I wanted to find a reliable data source for my practicum project in religions. As a result, I found the World Religion Project (WRP) that has regional and national datasets which are created by Zeev Maoz, University of California-Davis, and Errol A. Henderson, Pennsylvania State University.
WRP regional and national datasets contain information about the census of religions in different regions and countries. In this project, I want to benefit from the data that gives me valuable information about religions and where they exist.  

### Let Get Started Using Tableau
